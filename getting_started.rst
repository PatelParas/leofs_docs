   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting Started
================================

-------------------
System Requirements
-------------------
LeoFS development currently targets Debian 6, Ubuntu-Server 12.04 LTS and CentOS 6.x, but should work on
most Linux platforms with the following software:

* Erlang OTP R14B04 <http://www.erlang.org/download_release/12>

And the following erlang libraries:

* Basho bitcask <https://github.com/basho/bitcask>
* Mochimedia Mochweb <https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb>
* Ninenines Cowboy <https://github.com/essen/cowboy>
* Boundary Folsom <https://github.com/boundary/folsom>

And we recommend you to use on 64bit builds because of having to handle large files.
